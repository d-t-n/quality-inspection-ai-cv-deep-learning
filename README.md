# Quality Inspection using AI - Computer Vision with Deep Learning
 Inspecting products to ensure quality is a critical process where they are evaluated for acceptance or rejection. Usually, this involves a human operator examining the product to determine its status, but there are many factors that impact the inspection process, resulting in an 80% accuracy rate. Plus, manual inspection is expensive and time-consuming. Fortunately, computer vision (CV) algorithms can automate parts of the inspection process, but there are still challenges that need to be addressed. This repository describes AI-based approaches using Deep Learning (DL), making a benchmark of multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and performance comparison specifically for inspection. Feel free to contribute.
